# File Creator Web App Documentation

## Overview

The File Creator Web App is a simple tool that allows you to create text files directly in your browser and download them. This can be useful for quickly creating notes, drafts, or code snippets without needing a separate text editor.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Application:** Navigate to the `file-creator-webapp` folder in the repository. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2.  **Enter File Content:** On the webpage, you will see a large text area labeled "Enter file content:". Type or paste the text content you want to save into this area.

3.  **Create and Download File:** Click the button labeled "Create File". 

4.  **File Download:**  After clicking "Create File", the application will automatically generate a text file (`.txt`) with the content you entered and prompt you to download it.  The filename will be automatically generated. Save the file to your desired location on your computer.
