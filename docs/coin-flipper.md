# Coin Flipper Documentation

## Overview

The Coin Flipper is a simple web application that simulates flipping a coin. It's a fun and easy way to make a quick decision between two options, represented by "Heads" or "Tails".

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Application:** Navigate to the `Coin-Flipper` folder in the repository. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2.  **Flip the Coin:** On the webpage, you will see a button labeled "Flip Coin". Click this button to flip the coin.

3.  **View the Result:** After clicking the button, the application will randomly choose either "Heads" or "Tails" and display the result on the screen. An image of the coin landing on either heads or tails will also be shown.

4.  **Flip Again:** To flip the coin again, simply click the "Flip Coin" button again. You can flip the coin as many times as you like.
