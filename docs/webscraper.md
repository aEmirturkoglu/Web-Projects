# Web Scraper Documentation

## Overview

The Web Scraper project appears to be a Python script (`scraper.py`) designed to extract data from websites.  Web scraping is the process of automatically collecting information from the World Wide Web. This script likely targets specific websites and extracts particular pieces of data.  

**Note:** Unlike the other projects which are web applications with `index.html` files, this project is a Python script that is run from the command line.

## How to Use

To use the web scraper, you need to have Python installed on your computer.

1.  **Navigate to the Project Folder:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `webscraper` folder.

2.  **Run the Python Script:** Execute the web scraper script using the Python interpreter. The basic command is:

    ```bash
    python scraper.py
    ```

3.  **Check for Output:** The script will run and attempt to scrape data from the target website(s). The output of the script (the scraped data) will likely be displayed in your terminal. It might also save the data to a file, depending on how the script is written.  **Examine the `scraper.py` file to understand where the output is directed.**

4.  **Examine `scraper.py` for Details:** To understand exactly what data is scraped and from which websites, and how to configure or modify the scraper, you will need to read the `scraper.py` Python script.  

    *   **Open `scraper.py` in a text editor:** You can use VS Code or any text editor to open and read the `scraper.py` file.
    *   **Look for comments and code:** The script should contain comments explaining its purpose and how it works.  Examine the code to see which websites are being targeted and what data is being extracted.
    *   **Configuration:**  The script might have configurable variables at the beginning that you can modify (e.g., website URLs, data fields to extract, output file names).

This diagram outlines how to run the web scraper.  You need to navigate to the `webscraper` folder in your terminal and run the `python scraper.py` command. The scraped data will be outputted to the terminal or a file. For detailed understanding and configuration, you need to examine the `scraper.py` script itself.
