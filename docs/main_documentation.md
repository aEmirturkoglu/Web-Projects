## General Instructions for Use

Most of these projects are web applications that you can open directly in your web browser.  Here's how you can generally use them:

1.  **Download the project:**  If you've downloaded this repository as a zip file, extract it to a folder on your computer. If you are using Git, clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  **Navigate to the project folder:** Open the main folder of the project you want to use (e.g., `birthdaycalc`, `Calculator-Final`).
3.  **Open the `index.html` file:** Inside each project folder, you should find a file named `index.html`. Double-click this file to open it in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).
4.  **Use the application:** The web application should now be running in your browser. Follow the instructions on the project's documentation page to learn how to use it.

If a project requires additional steps or has specific instructions, it will be mentioned in its individual documentation.
