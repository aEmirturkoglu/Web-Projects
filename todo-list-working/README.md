# To-Do List Documentation

## Overview

This is a simple web-based To-Do List application that helps you manage your tasks. You can add tasks to the list, mark them as completed, and remove them. It's a useful tool for staying organized and keeping track of what you need to do.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Application:** Navigate to the `todo-list-working` folder in the repository. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2.  **View Current To-Do List:** When you open the application, you will see a list of to-do items (if any have been added previously). Initially, the list might be empty.

3.  **Add a New Task:**
    *   Locate the input field, usually labeled "Add task..." or similar.
    *   Type the description of the task you want to add into this field.
    *   Press Enter on your keyboard or click the "Add" button (if available) to add the task to the list.

4.  **Mark Task as Completed:**
    *   For each task in the list, there is usually a checkbox or a similar interactive element next to it.
    *   Click on this checkbox to mark the task as completed. Completed tasks might be visually distinguished (e.g., crossed out).

5.  **Remove a Task:**
    *   Each task item might have a "Remove" button (often an "X" icon or similar).
    *   Click this "Remove" button to delete the task from the list.

6.  **Persistence (Saving Tasks):** This simple to-do list likely stores tasks in your browser's local storage. This means your tasks will be saved and will reappear when you reopen the `index.html` file in the same browser on the same computer. However, tasks are not saved across different browsers or devices.

This diagram illustrates the basic interactions with the To-Do List application. You can add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them. Tasks are typically saved in your browser's local storage for persistence within the same browser and computer.
